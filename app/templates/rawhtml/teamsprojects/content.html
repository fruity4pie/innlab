					<p>The frequent and long charging times of lowenergy density, bulky and expensive batteries are major obstacles to widespread Electric Vehicles (EV) commercialization that must be overcome to challenge the 300-mile range of gasoline-powered
						vehicles. This problem can be solved through wireless power transfer technology, categorized as stationary and dynamic, in which EVs can be charged via electromagnetic induction without connecting a cable. To realize an EV dynamic charging
						system, several challenges need to be well investigated.</p>
					<p>For energy management, each EV should reserve dynamic charging service that requires route planning and secure payment system, while maintaining the privacy of the EV’s drives. This proposal aims to develop a comprehensive secure
